# Artificial Taxonomist - AT (@)
This Project intends to explore machine learning to identify herbarium vouchers, inspired by works below.

##Rationale

The rise of virtual herbaria, such as REFLORA, made available millions of high-resolution images which can be used to train an Artificial Intelligence-based infrastructure to help the identification od indetermined vouchers.
